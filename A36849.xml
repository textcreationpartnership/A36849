            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Great Loyalty of the PAPISTS to King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> (Of Bleſſed Memory.)</head>
            <p>WHen the buſineſſes of the late bad times are once ripe for an hiſtory, and Time the bringer forth of truth, hath diſcovered the myſteries of Iniquity, and the depths of Satan which have wrought ſo much crime and miſchief, it will be found, that the late Rebellion was raiſed and foſtered by the Arts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> That Jeſuites profeſſed themſelves Independent, as not depending on the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and Fifth-Monarchy-Men, that they might pull down the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and that in the Committees, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the King and the Church, they had their Spies and their Agents. The <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt and Confeſſour is known, who when he ſaw the fatal ſtroke given to our holy King and Martyr, flouriſhed with his ſword, and ſaid; Now the greateſt enemy that we have in the world is gone,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48801:3"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 117 -->
            <p>When the news of that horrible execution came to <hi>Roan,</hi> a Proteſtant Gentleman of good credit was preſent in a great company of Jeſuited perſons: where after great expreſſions of Joy, the graveſt of the company, to whom all gave ear, ſpake much after this manner; <hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>at his Marriage had promis'd us the re-establiſhing of the Catholick Religion in</hi> England;<note place="margin">Which is falſe.</note> 
               <hi>and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed to fulfill his promiſe, we ſummoned him from time to time to perform it: We came ſo far as to tell him, that if he would not do it, we ſhould be forced to take thoſe courſes which would bring him to his deſtruction. We have given him lawful warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when no warning would ſerve, we have kept our word to him, ſince he would not keep his word to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That grave Rabbies Sentence agreeth with this certain Intelligence which ſhall be juſtified whenſoever Authority will require it: That the year before the Kings death, a ſelect number of Engliſh Jeſuites were ſent from their whole party in <hi>England;</hi> firſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> to conſult with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> then altogether Jeſuited; to whom they put this queſtion in Writing:</p>

               <head>That ſeeing the State of ENGLAND, was in a likely posture to change Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it was lawful for the Catholicks to work that Change, for the advancing and ſecuring of the Catholick Cauſe in ENGLAND, by making away ihe King, whom there was no hope to turn from his Hereſie? Which was anſwered Affirmatively.</head>
               <p>After which the ſame perſons went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the ſame queſtion being propounded and debated, it was concluded by the Pope and his Council, that it was both lawful and expedient for the Catholicks to promote that alteration of State. What followed that Conſultation and ſentence, all the world knoweth, and how the Jeſuites went to work, God knoweth; and Time the bringer forth of Truth, will let us know. But when the horrible Parricide committed on the Kings ſacred Perſon, was ſo univerſally cryed down as the greateſt Villany that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in many ages, the Pope commanded all the papers about that queſtion to be gathered and burnt; In obedience to which Order, a Roman Catholick in <hi>Paris,</hi> was demanded a Copy which he had of thoſe papers; But the Gentleman who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48801:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 118 -->had had time to conſider and deteſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that project, refuſed to give it, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to a Proteſtant friend of his; and related to him the whole carriage of this negotiation, with great abhorrency of the practices of the Jeſuites,</p>
               <p>In purſuance of that Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the pulling down both the Monarch and the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> many Jeſuites came over, who took ſeveral ſhapes to go about their work, but moſt of them took party in the Army. About Thirty of them were met by a Proteſtant Gentleman between <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Diep;</hi> to whom they ſaid (taking him for one of their party) that they were going into <hi>England,</hi> and would take Arms in the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Army, and endeavour to be Agitators,</p>
               <p>A Proteſtant Lady living in <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of our late calamities, was perſwaded by a Jeſuit going in ſcarlet, to turn Roman Catholick: When the diſmal news of the Kings Murther came to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Lady, as all other good Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, was moſt deeply afflicted with it. And when this Scarlet Divine came to ſee her, and found her melting in tears, about that heavy and common diſaſter; he told her with a ſmiling countenance, that ſhe had no reaſon to lament, but rather to rejoyce, ſeeing that the Catholicks were rid of their greateſt enemy, and that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cauſe was much furthered by his death.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48801:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 118 -->Upon which the Lady in great anger put the man down the ſtairs: ſaying, If that be your Religion, I have done with you for ever. And God hath given her the grace to make her word good hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
               <p>Many intelligent Travellers can tell of the great joy among the Engliſh Convents and Seminaries, about the Kings death, as having overcome their enemy, and done their main work for their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in <hi>England;</hi> of which they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſure, that the <hi>Benedictins</hi> were in great care that the Jeſuites ſhould not get their Land, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nuns were contending who ſhould be Abbeſſes in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An underſtanding Gentleman viſiting the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> put them upon the diſcourſe of the Kings Death, and to pump out their ſenſe about it; ſaid that the Jeſuits had laboured very much to compaſs that great work: To which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Jeſuits would engroſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the glory of all great and good works, and of this among other works; whereas they had laboured as diligently and effectually for it, as they. So there was ſtriving for the glory of that atchievement, and the Friars ſhewed themſelves as much Jeſuited as the Jeſuits.</p>

In the height of <hi>Oliver's</hi> Tyranny, <hi>Thomas White</hi> Gentleman, a Prieſt, and a right Jeſuite in all his Principles about obediene, ſet out a Book Entituled, the <hi>Grounds of Obedience and Government,</hi> Wherein he maintains that, <q>If the People by any circumſtance be devolved to the State of Anarchy,<note place="margin">pag. 122.</note> their promiſe made <hi>(to their expelled Governour)</hi> binds no more. That the people are remitted by the evil managing and inſufficiency of their Governour, to the force of Nature to provide for themſelves, and not bound by any promiſe made to their Governour.<note place="margin">pag. 123. &amp; 124,</note> That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by his miſcarriages abdicateth himſelf from being a Magiſtrate, and proveth a Brigand or Robber inſtead of a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q> 
                  <hi>That word</hi> Defender, <hi>he writes with a great</hi> D, <hi>that the reader may take notice whom he means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Magiſtrate <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> have truly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be diſpoſſeſſed; or if he be rationally doubted,<note place="margin">pag. 133.</note> that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and be actually out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion. In the former caſe, it is certain the Subject hath no Obligation to hazard for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but rather to hinder it: For ſince it is the common good that both the Magiſtrate and the Subject are to aim at, and clearly out of what is expreſt, it is the common harm to admit again
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48801:5"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 119 -->of ſuch a Magiſtrate, every one to his power is bound to reſiſt him. The next caſe is, if he be innocent,<note place="margin">pag. 135,</note> and wrongfully depoſed; nay let us add, One who had governed well, and deſerved much of the Commonwealth, yet is he totally diſpoſſeſſed: And ſo that it is plain in theſe Circumſtances, It were better for the Common good to ſtay as they are, than to venture the reſtoring him, becauſe of the publick hazard.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now to ſet down all his words, and follow his ſtyle, which is affectedly intricate and obſcure, he maintaineth that a diſpoſſeſſed Prince, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by right or wrong, <q>is obliged abſolutely to renounce all Right and claim to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and if he does not,<note place="margin">pag. 136.</note> he is worſe then an Infidel.</q>
               </p>

                  <hi>He</hi> comes ſo far as to conclude; That if the old Magiſtrate offer to return, he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by force of Arms. His reaſoning is this;</p>

               <p>This was the Philoſophy of that contemplative Gentleman, when the King lived in Exile, and <hi>Oliver</hi> ſate on the Throne. <hi>Having</hi> ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the King, he was not long ſince highly recommended to his Majeſty, by a man of great Note.

               <p>When his Majeſty caſt himſelf upon the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, the Jeſuitical party thought they had him ſure enough from ever returning; but God diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their hopes, and deceived our fears by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous mercy; For it is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes, that he ſcaped out of thoſe hands.</p>
               <p>I cannot leave un-obſerved, That in the height of the late tyranny, two heads of the Gun-powder Traitors that were ſet upon the Houſe of Lords, were taken down; not by the high winds, but by the ſame zeal which had had plotted that Treaſon, and with the leave of Traitors of another feather. We may hear in time that thoſe holy Reliques are ſhrined up in gold, and are working miracles.</p>
